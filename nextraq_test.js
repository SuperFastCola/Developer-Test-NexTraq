2.3.x of Google's famous OS still running on 50.8 per cent of devices \u2013 and that's two years after it was initially launched.<\/p><p>Gingerbread has seen a drop over the last few months, as it

rumours","link":"http:\/\/feedproxy.google.com\/~r\/techradar\/us\/news\/phone\/~3\/feHbArUZ2pw\/story01.htm","description":"<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.mos.techradar.com\/\/art\/mobile_phones\/Samsung\/GalaxyS3\/Press\/GalaxyS3-02-470-75.jpg\" alt=\"Updated: Samsung Galaxy S4 release date, news and rumours\"\/><h3>Samsung Galaxy S4: release date and news<\/h3><p>It certainly feels like Samsung is taking over the world right now \u2013 at least, the Android world. There's no doubt that last year's <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.techradar.com\/reviews\/phones\/mobile-phones\/samsung-galaxy-s2-930907\/review\">Galaxy S2<\/a> was arguably the phone of the year. <\/p><p>And not in recent times, discounting Apple of course, can we remember the anticipation and expectation of a phone as much as the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.techradar.com\/reviews\/phones\/mobile-phones\/samsung-galaxy-s3-1078667\/review\">Galaxy S3<\/a>.<\/p><p>If you needed a barometer of this, just look at how it was unveiled. Not at MWC like lots of others, but its own event, proving the Galaxy line has reached the level where it can guarantee hoards will come just for an unveiling. <\/p><p>But that's last season's device, and we're looking forward to the next level of what to expect in the Galaxy SIV. The trickle of 'sources' talking about this new device is starting to build to a steady stream, so we're on hand to help let you know which whispers have a notion of truth about them - as well as providing our wishlist of what we want Samsung to improve on the new handset.<\/p><h3>Samsung Galaxy S4 screen<\/h3><p>The Galaxy S2 had an amazing Super AMOLED Plus display \u2013 and boy, was it vibrant. The S3 upped the screen size from 4.3-inches to 4.8-inches and the pixel density went from 217 to 306 to take a run at the iPhone's Retina Display.<\/p><p>But, Samsung also opted for a PenTile approach, to the chagrin of geeks. What does that mean for the end user? <\/p><p>Well, the screen looks great but you can make out pixels if you really, really strain. And some of the vivacity and colour saturation is lost. On the plus side, Samsung reckons the screen will last longer \u2013 but we'd rather see a much more S2-like screen with a sharper resolution - and given that's now appeared on the Samsung Galaxy Note 2, we're pretty hopeful we'll get it on the Samsung Galaxy S4 too.<\/p><p>Alternatively, there have been a number of rumours that Samsung is going to bring a flexible screen to the Galaxy S4 - but given the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.techradar.com\/news\/phone-and-communications\/mobile-phones\/samsung-evidently-pushes-flexible-amoled-display-release-to-2013-1106272\">Korean brand is already pushing the delivery of such tech back into 2013<\/a> for its customers, we think we'll be in Galaxy S5 territory before that happens.<\/p><p>There seems a much more likely option in the shape of the 5-inch 1080p screen that could offer up an eye-splitting 441ppi, making it easily the highest res out there. It would probably need to be shrunk down a smidge to fit into the palm, or Samsung could actually just make the phone even closer to the edges of the screen. Dare we dream of an edge-to-edge display like on the 9000 series TVs?<\/p><p>However, the bad news is that due to reported manufacturing issues these may have been delayed... does that mean the phone will have to be pushed back as well?<\/p><h3>Samsung Galaxy S4 release date<\/h3><p>It seems more than likely that Samsung will eschew MWC 2013 once more for the release of its top handset, instead focusing on the launch in May 2013, which we'd really like to see.<\/p><p>This makes sense for a number of reasons: time to allow the current customers to buy the S3, being able to scoop up all the customers about to come out of contract from the S2 and also not making its fans feel like its throwing out a new flagship phone every three seconds.<\/p><p><img src=\"http:\/\/mos.futurenet.com\/techradar\/classifications\/Mobile%20Phones\/Samsung\/samsungunpackedifavid-420-90.jpg\" alt=\"Samsung galaxy s4 release date\" width=\"420\"><\/p><p>However, that didn't stop the rumour mill deciding that the Galaxy S4 launch was set for March 2013, based on something a Samsung 'representative' said to the media. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.techradar.com\/news\/phone-and-communications\/mobile-phones\/samsung-galaxy-s4-release-rumors-arent-true-1098323\">The brand quickly took to Twitter<\/a> to discredit the rumours, so it looks like the middle of the year launch is still firmly on the cards.<\/p><p>Since then another rumour, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.techradar.com\/news\/phone-and-communications\/mobile-phones\/samsung-project-j-may-arrive-in-april-as-galaxy-s4-1116878\">of a phone dubbed 'Project J'<\/a>, has emerged, and that's set for an April unveil... so it seems we're looking at a Q2 2013 Samsung Galaxy S4 launch as it stands, which means you'll probably be able to actually hold one in your hands come May.<\/p><h3>Samsung Galaxy S4 specs<\/h3><p>There's not a lot around about specs at the moment, but the rumours emanating from the good ol' internet rumour mill are certainly enough to make us excited.<\/p><p>The first is that the S4 will have a quad-core chip, which might sound a little 'last gen' to many. However, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.techradar.com\/news\/phone-and-communications\/mobile-phones\/galaxy-s4-rumors-point-to-quad-core-a15-chip-13mp-camera-1114046\">it will be based on ARM's A15 architecture<\/a>, bringing with it a big boost in power for all those resource-intensive tasks we love to do all the time.<\/p><p>But then again, that's not Samsung's way really, is it? We want to see bigger, bangier and faster, so doubling it again to an <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.techradar.com\/news\/phone-and-communications\/mobile-phones\/eight-core-samsung-galaxy-s4-on-horizon-1114243\">OCTO-core would be the way to go<\/a>.<\/p><p>Rather than just making it super powerful though, the eight core innards would split into two groups: A15-spec chips for the big stuff, and A7 when things need to get a little lower power, bringing with it the best of both worlds.<\/p><p>The other big news that we think should be on our wish list is the fact that Samsung's internal storage bods have been hard at work <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.techradar.com\/news\/phone-and-communications\/mobile-phones\/samsungs-new-storage-chip-will-bring-thinner-faster-smartphones-1112762\">bringing the flash memory down in size and up in speed<\/a>... so think even thinner phones with higher capacity that can be written to up to 10x faster. We're now looking forward to the S4 even more now.<\/p><h3>Samsung Galaxy S4 battery<\/h3><p>Ok, we admit we always want more. The S2's 1,650mAh was manageable and the S3's 2,100mAh blows that out of the water. But it's still only OK. <\/p><p>You can get by on a day of moderate use but if you use this phone heavily (and we're talking watching TV shows on the morning and evening commute alongside your normal tinkering), this handset will still want a plug in at some point. <\/p><p>Motorola has proven it can be done by whacking a 3,300mAh power pack into the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.techradar.com\/reviews\/phones\/mobile-phones\/motorola-droid-razr-maxx-1063116\/review\">RAZR Maxx<\/a> which can still be considered a skinny Minnie. Something of that size \u2013 along with ICS and Samsung's power management abilities \u2013 would really be the icing on the Ice Cream Sandwich.<\/p><h3>Samsung Galaxy S4 design<\/h3><p>We've lost count of the amount of people we've shown our device off to who've replied with the words: &#34;Yeah, it's great but looks like a bit of a toy.&#34; It's a double-edged sword: the plastic is used to keep this handset nice and light, but does detract from what should be a premium device. <\/p><p>A bit of glass wouldn't go amiss. Android users, say what you like about the iPhone 4\/4S (and we know you won't be short of words), but aside from being smash-tastic, the glass really adds that premium and expensive feel that the S3 just doesn't have. <\/p><p>Forget what your mum told you \u2013 it's what's on the outside that counts too, so the Samsung Galaxy S4 needs to step it up in the design stakes.<\/p><h3>Better S-Voice<\/h3><p><img src=\"http:\/\/mos.futurenet.com\/techradar\/art\/mobile_phones\/Samsung\/GalaxyS3\/Galaxy%20S3%20review\/Screenshots\/Samsung_Galaxy_S3_review_o_01-210-100.jpg\" alt=\"Galaxy S4 review\" width=\"210\" class=\"lft\">S-Voice just isn't there. At least Siri had the nous to call itself a BETA so that it could be excused for not getting things right at times. The problem we have with S-Voice is it just doesn't seem to be able to do much. <\/p><p>Sure, it can tell you what the weather is like if you really can't be bothered to look out the window. And it'll save you 10 seconds by setting an alarm.<\/p><p> But it's just not powerful enough - and is, frankly, awful for something that's supposed to be a headline feature on one of the world's best smartphones. <\/p><p>We've actually been using Speak To It Assistant far more often because it's superior. Samsung could do worse than buy a company like this to give the Galaxy S4 a real chance of being the best voice-controlled mobile out there.<\/p><h3>Better Mac support<\/h3><p>Yep, we know many consumers believe Mac users account for only 0.000001% of Android owners (why wouldn't they just buy an iPhone, right?)<\/p><p>But there are lots who like Apple computers as well as Android devices. And up until the S3, they got on famously. <\/p><p>But Android has changed the rules and how storage works so that it follows the MTP Protocol which plays along brilliantly with Windows but can't stand Macs. <\/p><p>Yes, we know this is a Google issue and not something that Samsung can be blamed for. But having said that, the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.techradar.com\/reviews\/phones\/mobile-phones\/htc-one-x-1069319\/review\">HTC One X<\/a> also runs Ice Cream Sandwich and it has managed to tweak the code enough for there to not be a problem.<\/p><p>Please Samsung \u2013 don't shut them out. Ice Cream Sandwich may be frozen \u2013 but we shouldn't be, so when you bring out the Jelly Bean or Key Lime Pie-powered Galaxy S4, let's get some support.<\/p><h3>Samsung Galaxy S4 accessories<\/h3><p>Samsung unveiled the SIII alongside a raft of accessories \u2013 the usual things like cases were complimented by the C-Pen (like the Note 2's S-Pen but smaller) and the dongle for connecting to your TV to stream stuff. <\/p><p>The problem is, they're all so expensive: \u00a320 for the C-Pen and the best part of \u00a370 for the AllShare Dongle. They're not mainstream accessories \u2013 and little wonder. <\/p><p>If Samsung made these cheaper \u2013 or even threw them into the box for the Galaxy S4 (highly unlikely, but we can dream) then it would make for a much happier customer.<\/p><p>Perhaps a premium package where you spend a little more but get the accessories at the same time would work... people like to get the most out of things when they get their shiny new device.<\/p><h3>Better charging<\/h3><p>Plug it in and charge until it's full. That's always been the way. But we'd love to see a more advanced version of charging - ditching the wires should be more prevalent. <\/p><p><img src=\"http:\/\/mos.futurenet.com\/techradar\/art\/mobile_phones\/Samsung\/GalaxyS3\/Galaxy%20S3%20review\/Galaxy%20S3%20nature\/Samsung_Galaxy_S_III_review_20-420-100.jpg\" alt=\"Galaxy S4\" width=\"420\"><\/p><p>Maybe something similar to the conductive methods used by Palm in the Pre which never really caught on. The idea being that you don't have to plug the phone in to charge, just place it on a particular mat or place and it does it automatically.The S3 has that functionality, but it's hardly been well-publicised since launch.<\/p><p>The likes of Nokia with the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.techradar.com\/reviews\/phones\/mobile-phones\/nokia-lumia-920-1094960\/review\">Lumia 920<\/a> have been banging on about the amazing world of wireless charging for ages now, with a range of accessories too. Given that it will all be based on the Qi wireless charging standard, we'll soon see reams of coffee shops and airports with these charging stations littered around - just don't forget to watch your phone.<\/p><p>Or how about something really radical \u2013 like a battery that can also charge kinetically on the S4. Sure, it would be slow but wouldn't it be great if you could go for a run and manage to gain an extra 10 or 20% just by doing so to get you through the day? Radical \u2013 yes. But Samsung is known for its innovation.<\/p><h3>Improved speakers<\/h3><p>As beautiful and wonderful as the S3 is, the speaker still sounds tinny. Ringtones sound cheap and when it is on its back, they're also muffled. At least the iPhone has a bit of bass. <\/p><p>But what about going a bit further? Have three or four powerful but small speakers around the rim so when you play music, it comes out loud and with a bit of bass. <\/p><p>Hell, even make it so strong that it negates the need for a travel dock so you can play music at a decent volume when you nip away for the weekend or are sitting on the beach. That'd be a real selling point.<\/p><img width='1' height='1' src='http:\/\/techradar.feedsportal.com\/c\/34832\/f\/641931\/s\/263ea7cd\/mf.gif' border='0'\/><div class='mf-related'><p>Related Stories<\/p><ul><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href='http:\/\/techradar.feedsportal.com\/c\/34832\/f\/641931\/s\/2606b84c\/l\/0L0Stechradar0N0Cus0Cnews0Cphone0Eand0Ecommunications0Cmobile0Ephones0Cfoxconn0Erumored0Eas0Esurface0Ephone0Emanufacturer0Eamazon0Ephone0Etoo0E11157480Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fall\/story01.htm'>Foxconn rumored as Surface phone manufacturer, Amazon phone too<\/a><\/li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href='http:\/\/techradar.feedsportal.com\/c\/34832\/f\/641931\/s\/2635c85b\/l\/0L0Stechradar0N0Cus0Cnews0Cphone0Eand0Ecommunications0Cmobile0Ephones0Cnokia0Eputs0Eend0Eto0Eridiculous0Eandroid0Especulation0E11167880Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fall\/story01.htm'>Nokia puts end to ridiculous Android speculation<\/a><\/li><li><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href='http:\/\/techradar.feedsportal.com\/c\/34832\/f\/641931\/s\/263a5cb6\/l\/0L0Stechradar0N0Cus0Cnews0Cphone0Eand0Ecommunications0Cmobile0Ephones0Cafter0Eholdup0Ehtc0Eone0Evx0Efinally0Earriving0Eon0Eat0Et0Edec0E70E11169270Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fall\/story01.htm'>After holdup, HTC One VX finally arriving on AT&T Dec. 7<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/div><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/share.feedsportal.com\/viral\/sendEmail.cfm?lang=en&title=Updated%3A+Samsung+Galaxy+S4+release+date%2C+news+and+rumours&link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fus%2Fnews%2Fphone-and-communications%2Fmobile-phones%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s4-release-date-news-and-rumours-1089523%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dall\"><img src=\"http:\/\/res3.feedsportal.com\/images\/emailthis2.gif\" border=\"0\"\/><\/a><\/td><td valign='middle'><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/res.feedsportal.com\/viral\/bookmark.cfm?title=Updated%3A+Samsung+Galaxy+S4+release+date%2C+news+and+rumours&link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fus%2Fnews%2Fphone-and-communications%2Fmobile-phones%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s4-release-date-news-and-rumours-1089523%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dall\"><img src=\"http:\/\/res3.feedsportal.com\/images\/bookmark.gif\" border=\"0\"\/><\/a><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/div><img src=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/~r\/techradar\/us\/news\/phone\/~4\/feHbArUZ2pw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"\/>","category":{"domain":"","content":"mobile phones, phone and communications"},"pubDate":"Tue, 04 Dec 2012 09:32:00 GMT","guid":{"isPermaLink":"false","content":"http:\/\/www.techradar.com\/1089523"},"dc:creator":"Gareth Beavis","dc:date":"2012-12-04T09:32:00Z","y:published":{"hour":"9","timezone":"UTC","second":"0","month":"12","month_name":"December","minute":"32","utime":"1354613520","day":"4","day_ordinal_suffix":"th","day_of_week":"2","day_name":"Tuesday","year":"2012"},"y:id":{"permalink":"false","value":"http:\/\/www.techradar.com\/1089523"},"y:title":"Updated: Samsung Galaxy S4 release date, news and rumours"},{"title":"Optus no longer includes free social media in its postpaid data plans","link":"http:\/\/feedproxy.google.com\/~r\/techradar\/us\/news\/phone\/~3\/ynUp1279Shs\/story01.htm","description":"<img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.mos.techradar.com\/\/art\/mobile_phones\/Optus%20SIM\/optus%20sim-470-75.jpg\" alt=\"Optus no longer includes free social media in its postpaid data plans\"\/><p>Unmetered access to social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare and <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.techradar.com\/au\/reviews\/pc-mac\/software\/new-myspace-1113143\/review\">MySpace<\/a> has been a long tradition at Optus. But from Sunday, all that ended, with the network ending its free social networking offer for new postpaid customers.<\/p><p>Now, anyone who signs up for a postpaid contract on the network will have

balance between delivering value to our customers and the ongoing network investment required to ensure a good customer experience,&#34; the statement read.<\/p><p>To counter concerns about potential bill shock, Optus has halved the rate for excess data usage, with SMS notifications at the 50, 85 and 100 per cent marks of their data usage.<\/p><p>The telco has also introduced the ability to backdate data top up packs, allowing customers to get rid of unsightly overcharging after the fact once a month's data has been all used up.<\/p><img width='1' height='1'

so Samsung will likely tack onto that theme with the introduction of products (or the retooling of current devices) that fit into the health and wellness category. <\/p><p>Samsung has reportedly hired a design team that's worked with Nike on some of that company's branding initiatives, so we'll likely see some dynamic stuff from South Korea in Vegas. <\/p><p>As Samsung continues to grow from an Asian powerhouse to a global one, how it sells itself to a broad international audience will be key to its future. <\/p><p>We expect Stephen Woo, president of Samsung Electronics' device solutions division, to set the tone of the company's refreshed self during his keynote address Jan. 9. <\/p><h3>The debut of Ultra High-Definition television<\/h3><p>It took a while but CRT televisions have finally become the stuff of garage sales and trips to grandma's house, and 3D screens have just started to crack the home market.

However, Sony, always one to buck a naming trend (remember Blu-Ray vs. HD-DVD?) has said it will <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.techradar.com\/us\/news\/television\/hdtv\/sony-wants-to-keep-cumbersome-4k-ultra-high-definition-name-1105806\">stick with numbered moniker<\/a>, calling its pixel-dense displays 4K Ultra High-Definition (4K UHD).<\/p><p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn0.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net\/\/art\/televisions\/LG\/LG_UDTV_2-420-100.jpg\" alt=\"CES 2013\" width=\"420\" title=\"LG's 55-incher, we've its since topped\"><\/p><p>Still, everyone seems to be in agreement over the spec requirements set by the CEA, defining what it takes to be called Ultra HD. According to the group, Ultra means at least 8 million pixels, with a minimum resolution of 3840 x 2160, and an aspect ratio of at least 16 x 9.<\/p><p>Now the question is how big will the screens at CES 2013 be? There's debate between engineers as to whether anyone can even tell the difference between UHD and regular HD on a display that's less than 100-inches. And when will these TVs become affordable? Right now they're around $20,000 (UK\u00a312,515, AUD $19,210), keeping them firmly in Donald Trump and Richard Branson territory.<\/p><h3>Intel introduces a new mobile processor, stakes its claim<\/h3><p>Intel is probably one of the most recognizable names coming to CES 2013, though it's not the only chipmaker making a stand on the Vegas exhibit floor. <\/p><p>We expect Intel to show up big at the event, schooling the competition on how it's done, and very likely announcing a new mobile processor or two as well as some destined for PCs.<\/p><p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn0.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net\/\/\/art\/pc_processors\/Intel\/Intel%20Z2760-420-100.jpg\" alt=\"CES 2013\" width=\"420\"><\/p><p>Intel is in an interesting position in terms of its mobile future: although it claims to have 20 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.techradar.com\/reviews\/pc-mac\/software\/operating-systems\/windows-8-1093002\/review\">Windows 8<\/a> tablets sporting its new <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.techradar.com\/news\/computing-components\/processors\/intel-launches-new-mobile-processor-the-atom-z2760-for-windows-8-1100316\">Z2760<\/a> processor coming to market soon, the firm's chips are currently only found in six smartphones. <\/p><p>ARM and its licensees (Nvidia and Qualcomm) are making a killing in the mobile space and all are heading down to Nevada for the show, creating a perfect storm for one-up-man ship on the Strip. <\/p><p>ARM-based chips, while found in major money makers like the iPad and various Android tablets, aren't terribly up to snuff when it comes to processing prowess.<\/p><p>Yet Intel hasn't even breached the realm of relevancy smartphone space, making CES the time where it needs to stake that claim. <\/p><p>There's been <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.techradar.com\/news\/computing-components\/processors\/apple-reportedly-prepared-to-ditch-intel-processors-1110308\">talk<\/a> that Apple may chuck Intel as its CPU provider in the coming years.

It's got to prove it can work well with others (and capture consumer imagination) if it hopes to move deeper into smartphones and tablets.<\/p><h3>Nvidia trumps out Tegra 4<\/h3><p>Nvidia's Tegra 3 has done quite for itself this year, jumping into phones like HTC's <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.techradar.com\/us\/reviews\/phones\/mobile-phones\/htc-one-x-1101086\/review\">One X+<\/a> and tablets such as Google's <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.techradar.com\/us\/reviews\/pc-mac\/tablets\/google-nexus-7-1087040\/review\">Nexus 7<\/a> and Microsoft's <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.techradar.com\/us\/reviews\/pc-mac\/tablets\/microsoft-surface-tablet-1085839\/review\">Surface<\/a>. <\/p><p>That doesn't mean Nvidia doesn't have its eyes to the horizon, and we believe the company will introduce its Tegra 4 processor come CES. <\/p><p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn0.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net\/\/\/art\/graphics_cards\/Nvidia_Tegra_3-420-100.jpg\" alt=\"CES 2013\" width=\"420\" title=\"We might see the Tegra 3's successor at CES 2013\"><\/p><p>Word of the T40 (the new Tegra's model number) got going in April, with a report pointing to early 2013 as the time the Tegra 3's successor would ascend the throne. <\/p><p>At the time, it sounded like the Tegra 4 would fit four new Cortex A15 ARM chips, taking it way past the A9 Cortex chip summit. <\/p><p>Speeds of 1.8GHz are probably going to be average for the new processor, while by the middle\/end of the year, 2.0 should be its cruising GHz. <\/p><p>If we're lucky, we might even see an Android or Windows 8 tablet poke about with the Tegra 4 inside.<\/p><h3>Microsoft's show no more<\/h3><p>The Consumer Electronics Show has long been Microsoft's chance to shine. The software giant has always given flashy presentations, usually involving celebrities.

Qualcomm has nabbed the open keynote slot. The telecommunications mogul will be giving its Born Mobile keynote on Monday, January 7th. Meanwhile, satellite provider Dish and appliance manufacturer Hisense snapped up Microsoft's booth space in under an hour.<\/p><p>However, Venturebeat has quoted CEA president Gary Shapiro as saying, &#34;Microsoft will have something&#34; at CES 2013.

Its all in the realm of possibility.<\/p><h3>LG unveils Smart TV platform underpinned by HP's webOS <\/h3><p>While we expect LG to march out a bevvy of phones and TVs, including some we haven't seen before, what's really piquing our interest heading into the new year is word that it may launch a Smart TV service based on <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.techradar.com\/us\/news\/software\/operating-systems\/hp-introduces-webos-1-0-1100674\">webOS<\/a>. <\/p><p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn0.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net\/\/\/art\/logos\/HPWebOSLogo-420-100.jpg\" alt=\"CES 2013\" width=\"420\"><\/p><p>webOS, the open source system developed by HP, could take the reigns from LG's antiquated NetCast Smart TV interface during the show, a move that wouldn't leave our jaws dropped.<\/p><p>HP delivered on its promise to walk out webOS to the public by September, a vow it made in January, and now it needs a big product and solid partner to get its face out there. <\/p><p>The marriage between the two should be equal \u2013 reports have HP providing the OS while LG will plug in its dual-core L9-powered motherboards. <\/p><p>If our expectations pan out, we'll likely see the death of LG's small screen partnership with the struggling Google TV service, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.techradar.com\/us\/news\/television\/lg-unveils-integrated-google-tv-for-ces-2012-1052142\">a relationship LG championed at CES 2012<\/a> yet has since cooled.<\/p><h3>Automotive electronics<\/h3><p>The CEA estimates that factory-installed automotive technology will generate $8.7 billion dollars in 2013, so it's no wonder seven major car companies will be on the show floor.<\/p><p>Audi, Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Hyundai, Kia and Subaru will be joined more than 100 auto tech companies displaying the latest in-car tech. This is a record setting presence for the automotive industry at CES.<\/p><p>Displays and presentations will include electric drive technology. GoElectricDrive TechZone will demonstrate electric vehicles paired with their respective charging stations, ones that can be used at homes and in public facilities. The Safe Driver presentation will show more than the typical hands-free devices, highlighting technologies that can help drivers park, watch their speed and avoid collisions.<\/p><p>However, not everything between automakers and car tech designers is completely sunny. With so much hardware being put into cars before they even leave the factory, will the aftermarket industry be facing an all-time low? A presentation titled &#34;Are Automakers Running the Aftermarket Off the Road?&#34; will address the issue.<\/p><img width='1' height='1'

down from its One X big brother, but still packs impressive hardware for the price.<\/p><p>It has a 4.5-inch qHD scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass display, 1.2GHz dual-core Snapdragon S4 CPU, 4G LTE, a 5MP camera and 1080p video capabilities.<\/p><p>The One VX was originally announced for $49.99 with a two-year contract, and AT&#38;T has given no indication that the price changed with the delay.<\/p><p>The smartphone will run <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"

eager to get online<\/h3><p>TechRadar has reached out to Apple to learn more about the launch of iTunes in Russia, but in the meantime let's have a brief history lesson.<\/p><p>Russia has a checkered past when it comes to the internet and connected technologies, but in recent years its citizens have proved eager to join the online revolution.<\/p><p>In 2008 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.techradar.com\/news\/internet\/russians-invade-internet-459828\">Russians were the fastest-growing group of internet users<\/a> in Europe, and recent figures from global investment group GP Bullhound reportedly indicate that Russian internet use has continued to increase since then.<\/p><p>But <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.techradar.com\/news\/internet\/wikipedia-goes-dark-to-protest-web-censorship-in-russia-1088456\">Wikipedia went dark for a day<\/a> in Russia over the summer to protest internet censorship.<\/p><p>Specifically, Russian President Vladimir Putin was considering creating an online blacklist that would block Russians' access to sites the government deemed &#34;extremist&#34; or &#34;inappropriate.&#34;<\/p><p>Oddly, Russian officials even allowed a domestic ad firm to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.techradar.com\/news\/internet\/sideways-smileys-trademarked-in-russia-494681\">trademark emoticons<\/a> in 2009, demonstrating to some a fundamental lack of understanding of how the internet works.<\/p><h3>:'(<\/h3><p>According to TechCrunch, Russia is notorious for music piracy, though legitimate channels for digital downloads do exist there.<\/p><p>Regardless, an official iTunes storefront could help Apple penetrate the smartphone market in Russia, where Android is currently the top choice by a significant margin.<\/p><p>Apple's iTunes was originally scheduled to launch in Russia in October, but that date was reportedly pushed back to November, and then again to &#34;someday, maybe.&#34;<\/p><p>So Tuesday's event could be another tease, or it could mark the official launch of the Russian iTunes store. Either way, we'll know in a day.<\/p><img width='1' height='1' src='http:\/\/techradar.feedsportal.com\/c\/34832\/f\/641931\/s\/263a5cb8\/mf.gif' border='0'\/><div class='mf-viral'><table

offering by HTC, the Titan III, leading us to wonder if the Taiwanese phone maker might not be saving the best for last. <\/p><p>In a monthly questionnaire that asked Rewards participants how excited

1.5GHz dual-core. <\/p><p>An 8MP camera - the same found mounted in the Windows Phone 8X - and 42Mbps HSPA+ were also rumored features for the phone, which, if it's ever released, would be HTC's top-end Windows Phone 8 handset. <\/p><p>The addition of the third &#34;I&#34; could very well be a typo by the Xbox Live Rewards crew, though the Titan II <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"
